# UWT Game Dev Engine (Name Undecided)

A 2D video game engine written in C++ by the UWT Game Dev.

The UWT Game Dev engine is a project meant to span the lifetime of the UWT Game Dev club. Built in order to advance our skills in game development as well as C++ (a staple in the industry), it leverages the library SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) as well as C++ in order to create a working video game engine for use in 2D titles.
Starter code provided by Justin Goding in addition to Professor Dave Churchill at Memorial University.

## Current Features
- Basic 2D Rendering
- Implementation of basic ECS usage, a staple in the video game industry.
- 2D Collision
- Simple AI
- Input

## To set up the UWT Game Engine's environment for development:
1. Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
2. Download SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
3. Pull the code to a local repository
4. Open the project folder inside Visual Studio 2022.
5. Ensure that Visual Studios' SFML dependencies are changed to where your SFML folder is located on your PC. (For this part, seek out Justin or Alex for help until a proper tutorial is released).
6. Run / build the project. If something goes wrong contact a UWT Game Dev officer.
7. See coding best practices and the task board to see what you should code next!

Happy game dev!
